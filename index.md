# Walking Tale

Make your own location-based stories with pictures, sounds, and videos!

## Make your own adventure...

Walking Tale lets you create your own stories and experience the stories of others. Pictures, video, audio, and comments are automatically added to the map. Group this content together and you can make your very own "Walking Tale". 

Maybe you're new in town and looking for something fun -- pull Walking Tale up and see what the typical activity is. Share the perfect little hiking trail you found with the world -- snap some pictures along the hike, link them up, and now everyone can experience it.
